	The Fella Is A Bitch The Fella Is A Cuck<br>
	~<br>
	it didn't matter as much as the artistic references and the aesthetic style, crack art, ultra realist, hyper tone advancement clashes in the sky with alcoholic folkart tranquility. The realm of art is an opaque mystery. Questions had to be settled, wars fought, history made. Teams were forming across the globe, nations, regiments, squadrons, the russians already had some cool profile pics, clearly they had some strategy in their budget for memetic design, fucked up looking jacked dudes, track pants, vodka bottles, soviet housing core, slavic glitch textures on the shading. All things follow by a natural course, art, though appearing to be free, is confined to the disc, encoded in file systems and applications, but in that structure, much could happened, especially when two art discs are placed in competition with each other on a single computer, and that computer placed in competition with other computers, and those computers against other groups of computers, and so on, the web continuously expanding through the information channels, inevitably culturally interesting scenarios will erupt, and many dead bodies of artists over drained and suffering will pile up before they find their salvation in the clashing of electrons in the beautiful sky above, so said the wizard npc before Jofella got bored and crashed his system by trying to insert his balls into the cd tray.<br>

	To my holders:<br>
	I wanted to address a few issues for those with liquidity tied up in $MIF<br>
	<u><strong>On Fang</strong></u><br>
	When I began working on Mifella, Fang believe I was the biggest baddest ass super cool art world bro. He changed his opinion when I challenged him a bit. And that's gay. <u>I didn;t anticipate this.</u> I can say this because he doxed Mifella day one as "it's the same dev wallet as X" which is categorically untrue - he got his intel from lame little girl gossip.<br>
	<u><strong>On The Art</strong></u><br>
	I knew the art was different. I didn't know you all didn't have brains. <u>I didn't anticipate this.</u> Rather, I anticipated fang would say "Mifella is super cool badass art criticism" in his own grooming voice.<br>
	<u><strong>On Solana</strong></u><br>
	The future is multichain. Me and my crew got rich off Solana. I say possibillities of new liquidity in Solana ecosystem. I got a big bag at 10. SBF frauded in the way he did. <u>I didn't anticipate this.</u><br>
	<u><strong>On Milady's Financials</strong></u><br>
	More than 90% of Milady holders are wagies having trouble paying rent. <u>I didn't anticipate this.</u><br>
